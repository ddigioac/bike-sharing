# Bike-sharing Analysis

## Overview of Bike-sharing Analysis

### Purpose

In this analysis I will be creating visualizations consisting of bike-sharing data from New York City to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.

## Bike-sharing Results

Tripduration displays the 'Number of Bikes' and the length of the trip recorded in 'Minutes'.

Checkout Time for Users displays the 'Number of Bikes' and the length of the trip recorded in 'Minutes' with an additional breakdown by 'Gender'.

## Bike-sharing Summary 

After analyzing the NYC bike-sharing data, we concluded that more Males rent bikes than Females. We can also deduce during the weekday bikes are mostly rented for the morning commute to work and the commute home from work. On weekends most bikes are being returned during the afternoon from 1pm to 5pm. Lastly, more men are subscribers to this service than women. There are two additional visualizations I would recommend we complete for future analysis: (I) Birth year of Subscribers vs. Customers and (II) Trip duration of Subscribers vs. Customers.
